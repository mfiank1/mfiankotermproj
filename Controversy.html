          <h1> Controversy surrounding SOPA </h1>
			<img src="Contro.jpg" alt="Arguing">
          <p> The controversy surrounding SOPA was that it would essentially change into a referendum on who would control the growing landscape 
			of digital life. <i>Spearheaded by who?</i> major corportations of course, although it would seem like the government was the ones in control,
			they are the ones with the power and money to be able to influencce ssuuch decisions and have the resources to drag out any claims they file or filed against them, 
			stipling opppositions and cornering the digital markets for them and their supporters.
			</p>
		 
		<p> Ways SOPA could be abused </p>
				<li> SOPA gives corporations and indviduals the power to contact a websites payment provider and demand that they cutoff the infringingg site even if the website in question
					couldn't be held liable in the copurtss</li>
				<li> With the vague wording the proposed law could affect the many of the sites that host and support userr  generated content, such as  youtube, tik tok, facebook, etc.</li>
				<li> SOPA would give government authorities even more power to censor free speech by contacting ISP's, search engines and domain services, putting them on a blacklist that prevents 
					sites from being brought up</li>

            <h3> Who supported/opposition to the SOPA law </h3>
            <p> SOPA surprisingly had both bipartisian support in the Houuse of Representatives and in the Senate, It also received support from the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Governors Association, 
			The National Conference of Legislatures, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Attorneys General, the Chamber of Commerce, the Better Business Bureau, the AFL–CIO and 22 trade unions, 
			the National Consumers League, and many more</p>	
			<p>SOPA faced a lot of public backlash over fears that  legislation threatened free speech and innovation, and enabled law enforcement to block access to entire Internet domains due to infringing content 
			posted on a single blog or webpage adn that its just not fair  not only to the website, but also to the userss who come to rely on such websites for whatever their needs  </p>
