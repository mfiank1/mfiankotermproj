          <h2> What is Internet Activism? </h2>
		<img src="IntAct.jpg" alt="Protesting">
          <p> When people don't agree with a certain idea or philosophy whether political or not, they form groups centered around a common belief that  what they are doing is for the greater good, 
			over time ssuch groups can be a very powerful and inflential force to be reckoned with. Internet activism is online activism that aims to create change through the use of digital campaigning,
			online organizing, and using electronic communications to create change for the good of all peoples</p>

            <h3> How Internet Activism played a crutial part in taking down SOPA </h3>
            <p> People tend to think that <i>"oh im just one person, i cant change much"</i> but they're wrong all it takes is <em>ONE</em> person to be able to createe a spark that can turn a potentially corrupt or unfair political/social scene ablaze!
				and thats exactly what happened with SOPA people all aacross the nation realized that this new law not only unfair, but also has  the potential ttoo be abused and manipulated for the gain of a select few. 
				I was one of the internet activists in 2011/2012 back in high school messageing government officials in my state thrugh social media appps like twitter, faceboook, and instagram that SOPA is a law that could potentially harm the entire internet community, I remember signning online petitions 
				and urging classmates to do the samee because as denizens of the internet they too will eventually be effected by this law</p>
