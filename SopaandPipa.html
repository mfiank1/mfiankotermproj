          <h1> What are SOPA and PIPA  </h1>
			<img src="Cong.jpg" alt="Congress">
          <p> SOPA stands for Stop Online Piracy Act, the main idea of the law was to expand law enforcements ability to online jurisdictions in order to
			combat certain online crimes such as the selling of fake good online and copyright. The law also extended to laws like online piracy amd illegal streaming 
			of copyright protected material</p>
		<p> PIPA stands for Protect IP Act, the main idea of this bill was to give more power and tools to not only government officals but also to those with copyrighted content such as corporations.
			The bills main purpose was to help slow down the amount of sites popping up selling fake, illegal and counterfeit goods.   </p>
				 Abilites now gained from SOPA include
					<li> Court orders that can now prevent advertising networks and/or payment facilities from doing or taking any business from potentially unlawful sites</li>
					<li> Prevent search engines such as google, bing, etc from allowing others to link to the unlawful site</li>
					<li> Force ISPs to bolck others from acceesssing the infringing site </li>
